# FIT3162FYP
FIT3162 Final Year Project
Automatic Classification of Medical Modality Images using Local Binary Pattern, Shape Feature with KNN and SVM and Fusion Technique

The program can be executed using command 'python3 filename.py <argv 1>' in the terminal.

In default, the program will read 100 images from each classes, but it might be too long for testing purposes. Thus user can type the argument in <argv1>, the number inside will signifies the number of images user wants to read from each class. The input at <argv1> must stricly be an integer, else the program will crash.

Once the program is running, the result will be printed at the terminal, with labels showing which result it is.

Users need to have SciKit Learn, Numpy and openCV installed on their device to be able to run the code.
